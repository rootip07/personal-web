[Add your own image named 'photo1.jpg' to the project directory.]

## How to use a custom profile image

1. Place your image file (e.g., `photo1.jpg`) in the project folder.
2. In `index.html`, update the `<img src="...">` tag for the profile image:
   ```html
   <img src="photo1.jpg" alt="Profile">
   ```
3. Save and refresh your browser to see the new profile image.

> **Note:** The image file must be in the same directory as `index.html` for the path above to work.
